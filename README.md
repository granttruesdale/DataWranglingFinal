## Setup
To correctly run this project one should have the latest version of RStudio downloaded. Once complete, download the 'Final Project.R' script and the 'imdb_top_1000.csv' to your local desktop. Set the working directory to your desktop in RStudio and begin running the code within the R script. 

## Project Status
Project is: _complete_
> This was the final project in the Data Wrangling class; therefore, I have not revisited this project since December 2021 and it's considered complete. 

## Room for Improvement
- Look at the impact the pandemic had on earnings in the film industry
- How have streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu impacted movie earnings?
- Look at all movies overtime. This project analyzes only 193 films that were found in both datasets.
